1.3.2
=====
[Please note that this is a development release.]

Development release of xfce4-power-manager.
Please report all problems at bugzilla.xfce.org.

  Since there is only one panel plugin left it was renamed from "Battery
Indicator Plugin" to "Power Manager Plugin", which is more fitting as it
doesn't merely show the battery status.

  Xfce4-power-manager does not rely on special device icons anymore
that illustrate the load-status. Instead, the load-status is now drawn
with cairo on top of normal device icons that follow the naming of the
Adwaita icon-theme.

  Other changes:

 - Fix crash with slider on 32bit systems (Bug #11076)
 - Fix version number output on the commandline
 - Remove unused code
 - Add dedicated icons for the keyboard brightness notifications
 - Various icon improvements
 - Reorder parts of the settings dialog

1.3.1
=====
[Please note that this is a development release.]

Development release of xfce4-power-manager.
Please report all problems at bugzilla.xfce.org.

 Xfce4-power-manager has changed how the xfce4-pm-helper application
is used. Now the pm-helper is called by pkexec (provided by polkit),
which means for users of xfpm that have UPower 0.99 installed and
aren't using LoginD everything will work as before. In 1.3.0 options
in the settings dialogs were unavailable because xfpm was still
looking for the old UPower authorization rules which get uninstalled
on the upgrade to UPower 0.99.

  Simon Steinbeiss and Harald Judt have contributed many improvements
to the power manager settings dialog. Harald also added a minimum xfconf
value setting for the brightness slider so that users whose display goes
completely dark at 0 can exclude that value if they desire.

  The battery plugin can now be built as an LXDE plugin (Bug 10929).

  The brightness plugin has been merged into the battery indicator plugin.
This allows for the removal of duplicated code, puts all those settings in
one plugin, and allows us to easily provide that functionality to LXDE.

  The disk spin down feature was removed. The default settings for it
actually had it configured so that it would never work, it was using
the old UDisks 1 API, and would be useless for SSD drives and non-Linux
users.

  Other Changes:

 - Simon P fixed a memory corruption crash (Bug 11018).
 - OnlyShowIn was changed to a NotShowIn for the .desktop files (Bug 11009)
 - Selecting a device in the plugin brings up the details in the settings
   dialog.
 - Improve strings in devices tab and add percentage (Bug #6652)
 - Fork before gtk/dbus init
 - Andrzej Added support for multi-row panel layouts for the plugin
 - Restore screen power after sleep (Bug 10535)
 - Samuli Suominen fixed suspend/hibernate with UPower 0.9.23 (Bug 10931)
 - Carl Simonson added a notification popup when changing keyboard brightness
 - Minumum UPower requirement was lowere to 0.9.7 to support FreeBSD
 - Devices tab flickers on update (Bug 10937)
 - Improve lid-action strings (Bug #6515)
 - Carl Simonson added a reasonable step value for keyboard brightness
 - Let xfpm control X11's screensaver extension

1.3.0
=====
[Please note that this is a development release.]

Development release of xfce4-power-manager.
Please report all problems at bugzilla.xfce.org.

  This release has a large number of changes contributed by many
developers and translators.

  One of the most noticable changes to xfpm is a new panel plugin
to monitor battery and device charge levels which replaces the
trayicon. If anyone outside of Xfce was using xfce4-power-manager
in a different panel, such as LXDE, and wants xfpm to continue to
work there, request it in bugzilla and we'll work on it.

  The settings dialog has been completely restructured for better
oversight. Additionally, xfce4-power-information, a stand-alone
application has now been embedded inside the settings dialog.

  A new version of Upower, 0.99.0, breaks it's API compability
and xfpm required quite a bit of work to provide the same
functionality as previous versions of Upower. Concurrently,
several developers added support for systemd-logind in xfpm.
Xfce4-power-manager added a xfce4-pm-helper application to
suspend/hibernate on systems using upower 0.99.0 and higher.

  Jannis Pohlmann removed custom OSD brightness popup code and
it now uses libnotify so they can appear with any installed
notification daemon.

  Simon Steinbeiss created new icons for xfpm (based on the
Adwaita icon-theme) covering all the different device types
supported as well as all their individual states.

  Sonal Santan added support for keyboard backlight control.
This feature is useful when the firmware does not handle the
keyboard brightness control automatically.
