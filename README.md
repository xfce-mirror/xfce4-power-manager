# xfce4-power-manager

Xfce4-power-manager manages the power sources of the computer and connected 
devices (wireless mice, keyboards, media players etc.). It also allows users 
to control the display backlight brightness and set power-saving modes for 
displays and monitors.
In addition, xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus
interfaces to inform other applications about the current power level so that 
they can adjust their power consumption.
