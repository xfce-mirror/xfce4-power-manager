  <summary>Manage and reduce power consumption of computer and devices</summary>

  <description>
    <p>Xfce power manager manages the power sources on the computer
    and the devices that can be controlled to reduce their power
    consumption (such as LCD brightness level, monitor sleep,
    CPU frequency scaling).
    </p>
    <p>In addition, Xfce power manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant
    DBus interfaces to inform other applications about current power level
    so that they can adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit
    interface which allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions
    via the power manager; as an example, the operating system’s package manager
    should make use of this interface while it is performing update operations.
    </p>
    <p>Xfce power manager also provides a plugin for the Xfce and LXDE panels
    to control LCD brightness levels and to monitor battery and device charge
    levels.

    <release version="1.3.2" timestamp="1408573857">
      <description>
        <p>This development release mostly fixes bugs and introduces better support
        for icon-themes by reducing the device icons and using standard names for
        them. It also features updated translations. The panel plugin has been
        renamed to Power Manager Plugin.

    <release version="1.3.1" timestamp="1407741245">
      <description>
        <p>This development release fixes bugs with suspend and hibernate. It also
        improves the panel-plugin, incorporating the functionality of the (now
        dropped) brightness panel-plugin. A new popup notification was added to
        account for keyboard brightness changes and the Power Manager now also
        controls the X11 blank times.

    <release version="1.3.0" timestamp="1401646266">
      <description>
        <p>This development release introduces a lot of new features, among them
        suspending/hibernation without systemd and UPower>=0.99. It allows for
        individual control of systemd-inhibition, a new panel plugin to monitor
        battery and device charge levels replaces the trayicon. The settings dialog
        has been completely restructured for better oversight and many open bugs
        have been fixed and translations have been updated.
